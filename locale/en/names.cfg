[mod-setting-description]
geothermal-needs-water=Should the geothermal wells require water input, or should the water be 'provided' by the well? Requiring input makes logistics much more complicated. Note that changing this means you will have to replace any existing wells.
geothermal-power-factor=Adjust this to control how much power geothermal plants provide.
geothermal-fluid-production=Adjust this to control how much fluid each well provides. Directly correlates to per-well generation capacity, where each 25% increase represents 1-2 more steam engines. At 1x, each well can run 1.2 exchangers, which is about 3 steam engines at 1x power multiplier.
geothermal-frequency=A multiplier to control how often geothermal patches will generate.
geothermal-size=A multiplier to control how large geothermal regions are. Has no effect with AlienBiomes installed.
geothermal-color=AlienBiomes compatibility; Whether the geothermal patches spawning in colored magma biomes take on that color, as well as a chemical impurity representing that color.
geothermal-spawn-rules=Which biomes the geothermal patches are permitted to spawn in. Note that they have hardcoded per-biome frequencies as well, and restricting to biomes that do not actually exist will be the same as selecting "everywhere".
thermal-wagon=Whether a thermally insulated version of the fluid wagon should be enabled, to permit carrying heated water without it losing its temperature.
geothermal-byproduct-rate=A multiplier for the yield of byproducts from AlienBiomes colored geothermal patches.
geothermal-distance-scalar=How quickly spawn density rises with distance. Larger numbers increase the required distance to see a given density increase, by that factor.
geothermal-rate-clamp=The upper limit to the distance-based density scaling.
geothermal-min-distance=How far from spawn patches are permitted to generate.
